React Js Introduction - By Deepak Kushwaha

# What is ReactJs and Why it is Introduced ?


1. ReactJS is a JavaScript library primarily used for building user interfaces for web applications. 

2. It was introduced to make it easier and more efficient to create dynamic, interactive, and reusable UI components.

3. React helps developers build complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces called components. These components can be reused throughout the application, which simplifies development and maintenance.

4. React also efficiently updates and renders UI components when data changes, thanks to its virtual DOM (Document Object Model) technology. Overall, ReactJS was introduced to streamline web development, enhance performance, and improve the user experience.
